# Easy-TSIMS
A chrome extension to make WFLA's TSIMS more usable

## Installation
After downloading the code, you will have two versions of the distribution: one `/Easy-TSIMS-extension/` and one `/Easy-TSIMS-extension.crx`. Since the extension is not published to chrome webstore, the packed version is likely not going to work. Therefore, after navigating to `chrome://extensions`, turn on "developer mode", then select "load unpacked", and select the directory `/Easy-TSIMS-extension/` (the one with `manifest.json` in it). 

## Trouble-shooting
This extension is still under development. It is *not* guaranteed to be working under all environments. If you find any bug, please contact me in any way and I will be happy to help you debug.
