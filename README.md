# Easy-TSIMS
A chrome extension to make WFLA's TSIMS more usable
## Installation
After downloading the code, you will have two versions of the distribution: one `/Easy-TSIMS-extension/` and one `/Easy-TSIMS-extension.crx`. Since the extension is not published to chrome webstore, the packed version is likely not going to work. Therefore, after navigating to `chrome://extensions`, turn on "developer mode", then select "load unpacked", and select the directory `/Easy-TSIMS-extension/` (the one with `manifest.json` in it).
